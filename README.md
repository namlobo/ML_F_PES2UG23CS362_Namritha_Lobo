# Machine Learning Lab (UE23CS352A)
### A Collection of Lab Experiments for the Machine Learning Course

This repository contains all the laboratory assignments, notebooks, and reports completed for the **UE23CS352A: Machine Learning** course.  

Each lab includes:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** with full code implementation  
- **Plots/visualizations** for analysis  
- A **Lab Report (PDF or Docx)** answering the analysis questions  



## **Learning Outcomes**

Across these labs, the following skills were developed:

### Machine Learning Foundations
- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Understanding bias–variance tradeoff  
- Model interpretation  

### Supervised Learning
- Regression (Linear, Polynomial)  
- Classification (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes)  
- Tree-based methods (Decision Trees, Random Forests)  

### Unsupervised Learning
- PCA for dimensionality reduction  
- K-Means Clustering  
- Hierarchical Clustering (Bisecting K-Means)  

### Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC–AUC  
- Silhouette score  
- Cross-validation
